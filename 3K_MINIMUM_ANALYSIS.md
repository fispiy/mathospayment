## Key Findings: Why 3K Minimum Wins

### 1. **Massive Cost Savings**

**vs. Current Model (Model 1):**
- **Savings: $11,625 (63.5% reduction)**
- Cost per view: **63.0% lower** ($0.001725 vs $0.004656)
- Pays only for videos that actually perform (3K+ views)

**vs. CPM Model (Model 3):**
- **Savings: $7,008 (51.2% reduction)**
- Cost per view: **50.5% lower** ($0.001725 vs $0.003482)
- More efficient bonus structure

### 2. **Strategic Qualification Filter**

**The 3K minimum acts as a quality gate:**

- **Total videos in dataset:** 1,240 videos
- **Model 1 (no minimum):** 488 videos qualify (39.4%)
- **Model 6 (3K minimum):** 109 videos qualify (8.8%)
- **Difference:** 379 fewer videos paid (77.7% reduction)

**Why this matters:**
- Only pays for videos that demonstrate real engagement
- Eliminates payment for low-performing content
- Focuses budget on creators/content that drive results
- 3K views is a reasonable threshold that most quality content can achieve

### 3. **Cost Efficiency Metrics**

**Cost per Qualified Video:**
- Model 1: $37.52 per video
- Model 3: $28.06 per video
- **Model 6: $61.33 per video** (but only pays for 109 vs 488 videos)

**The Math:**
- Model 1 pays $37.52 × 488 videos = $18,310
- Model 6 pays $61.33 × 109 videos = $6,685
- **Result: 77.7% fewer payments, 63.5% lower total cost**

### 4. **Creator Incentive Analysis**

**3K Minimum maintains strong incentives:**

- **Base Rate:** $30/$40 per qualified video (competitive)
- **Bonus Structure:** Performance bonuses still apply ($3,255 total)
- **Qualification Rate:** 8.8% of videos qualify (reasonable threshold)
- **Creator Impact:** Top performers still earn well, low performers incentivized to improve

**Comparison:**
- Model 1: Pays for everything, but at lower rates ($30/$40 base)
- Model 6: Pays higher effective rate ($61.33/video) but only for quality content
- **Net effect:** Better ROI, stronger creator motivation to produce quality

- No minimum view threshold
- Pays for all content regardless of performance

**Problems:**
- High cost for low-performing content
- No incentive for creators to optimize
- Budget wasted on content that doesn't drive results

### 3K Minimum Model Advantages

**Our Approach:**
- Base rate: $30/$40 per video
- **Minimum threshold: 3K views on any platform**
- Performance bonuses for high-performing videos

**Benefits:**
1. **Quality Gate:** Only pays for content that demonstrates engagement
2. **Budget Efficiency:** 63.5% cost savings vs. traditional models
3. **Creator Incentive:** Still rewards top performers with bonuses
4. **Fair Threshold:** 3K views is achievable for quality content
5. **Platform Flexibility:** Works across Instagram, TikTok, YouTube

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### Model 6: 3K Minimum Base

```
Total Cost: $6,685.00
├── Base Costs: $3,430.00 (109 videos × $30/$40)
└── Performance Bonuses: $3,255.00 (based on total views)

Qualified Videos: 109 (8.8% of total)
Total Views: 3,875,741
Cost per View: $0.001725
```

### Model 1: Current Model (No Minimum)

```
Total Cost: $18,310.00
├── Base Costs: $15,020.00 (488 videos × $30/$40)
└── Performance Bonuses: $3,290.00 (based on total views)

Qualified Videos: 488 (39.4% of total)
Total Views: 3,932,586
Cost per View: $0.004656
```

**Key Difference:**
- Model 1 pays for **379 additional low-performing videos** ($11,625 extra cost)
- These videos average ~1,000 views each (below 3K threshold)
- **ROI:** Paying for 379 videos that don't drive meaningful engagement

## Why 3K Views is the Sweet Spot

### Too Low (No Minimum)
- **Problem:** Pays for content with minimal engagement
- **Example:** Video with 500 views still gets $30 base
- **Cost Impact:** Wastes budget on low-ROI content

### Too High (10K Minimum)
- **Problem:** Excludes too many quality videos
- **Example:** Video with 8K views gets nothing
- **Impact:** Reduces creator incentives, may lose good creators

### Just Right (3K Minimum)
- **Sweet Spot:** Filters out low performers, includes quality content
- **Example:** Video with 3K+ views gets base + bonuses
- **Result:** Optimal balance of cost efficiency and creator satisfaction

**Data Support:**
- 109 videos qualify at 3K threshold (8.8% qualification rate)
- Average views per qualified video: ~35,500 views
- **Quality indicator:** Videos that hit 3K+ tend to perform well overall

## ROI Analysis

### Cost per 1,000 Views (CPM Equivalent)

| Model | Cost per 1,000 Views | Industry Standard |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Model 1 | $4.66 | High |
| Model 3 | $3.48 | Medium-High |
| **Model 6** | **$1.73** | **Low (Best)** |
| Model 8 | $1.89 | Low |

**Industry Benchmark:** Standard UGC CPM ranges from $2-$5 per 1,000 views
- **Model 6 achieves $1.73 CPM** - significantly below industry average
- **63% better than Model 1** ($4.66 CPM)
- **50% better than Model 3** ($3.48 CPM)

### Budget Allocation Efficiency

**Model 1 Budget Breakdown:**
- Base costs: 82% ($15,020)
- Bonuses: 18% ($3,290)
- **Problem:** 82% goes to base payments, many for low-performing videos

**Model 6 Budget Breakdown:**
- Base costs: 51% ($3,430)
- Bonuses: 49% ($3,255)
- **Advantage:** More balanced allocation, bonuses reward performance

## Creator Impact Analysis

### Top Performers (High View Counts)

**Impact:** Minimal - still receive base + bonuses
- Model 1: $30 base + bonuses
- Model 6: $30 base + bonuses (same)
- **Result:** Top creators unaffected, still incentivized

### Mid-Tier Creators (3K-10K Views)

**Impact:** Positive - clear incentive to reach 3K threshold
- Model 1: Gets paid regardless
- Model 6: Must hit 3K to qualify
- **Result:** Motivates creators to optimize content

### Low Performers (<3K Views)

**Impact:** Encourages improvement
- Model 1: Gets paid for low-performing content
- Model 6: No payment until quality improves
- **Result:** Natural selection - encourages better content or filters out low performers
